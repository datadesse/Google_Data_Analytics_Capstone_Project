    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "I am acting as a data analyst at a medium-sized recruitment agency to help improve its sourcing of job vacancies\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The agency relies on multiple job posting sites to identify potential job openings for its clients. It searches through each site manually which is time-consuming and often leads to missed opportunities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "They want me to  analyse **Data Analyst** role advert data using web scraping tools that can ** automatically** extract job posting data from a job posting site.  The team will use my analysis to provide a more efficient way to provide job vacancies to better serve its clients. This feature will help the recruitment agency by getting relevant openings to their clients more quickly, giving their clients a competitive advantage over other applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- To  create a web scraping tool that can automatically extract data of  Data Analyst jobs from a job posting site\n",
    "- To increase the efficiency &  quality of job vacancy sourcing \n",
    "- To gain a competitive advantage\n",
    "- To give suggestions on my findings \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting a job posting site\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most job websites I tried have an anti-scraping filter which can affect my results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I have chosen **www.reed.co.uk** for this project because it is easier to scrape and specialised in advertising local jobs in the UK \n"
